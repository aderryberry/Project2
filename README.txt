Project 2 ReadMe file

> The objective of this project was to find the index of a station in a given txt document.
> Next you had to find the character, ASCII values and perform calculations on them.
> Finally you had to return the Ceiling, Floor and average of the average ASCII values
> You also had to output the stations computed

- To complete these objectives I created a PosAvg, LetterAvg class and edited other provided classes
- The first thing I did was create methods to read in the txt document and put in in an arraylist
- Next I wrote a method to calculate the number of stations with the same average letter
- Finally I wrote the toString for the letter average
- I also had a similar layout for PosAvg except I calculated the index and average stations
- I edited MesoInherit to calculate the ASCII calculations with methods that created the char values
- There was another method performing calculations on the found the char values
- MesoAbstract was used to create the abstract methods needed
